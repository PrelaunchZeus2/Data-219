# Heaps
#widly used for sorting purposes

# Max heap has the property that for every node i other than the root
# A[parent(i)] >= A[i]
# A min heap has the property that for every node i other than the root
# A[parent(i)] <= A[i]

#in a bst the maximum value is the right most value
#in a max heap the maximum value is the root, vice versa for min heap
