    " Data comes from a .csv file sourced from https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/washington-state/men/2024-gamelogs-advanced.html. I loaded it into Microsoft Excel and cleaned it dropping all of the stats collected for each game except the scores, date, school played, and location of the game. There were no missing or null values as the season has now ended and all of the data from each game was present. A few of the column names were not named in a way that would allow for easy access so I had to rename the WorL column as well as the dates. Additiionally, the location of the games is denoted using symbols. Previously it was left blank for a home game, had an @ symbol for an away game and an n for neutral venues. I decided to change thee symbols to capital letters and add H for home games instead of having a blank value."

    "Comparing finding the maximum and minimum value games we encounter our first limitation. Using the Binary Search Tree, it is a pretty quick operation with a big o notation of O(h) where h is the height of the tree meaning that because we just follow the tree down to the left or right the time we take is dependant on the number of nodes we traverse vertically. Using the Heap, it is much quicker with a big o notation of O(1) because the max or min is always the top most node. However the limitation is that depending on the type of heap you can only find the max or min in O(1) while the other is much slower because you have to search the entire tree for the other value.\n",
    "\n",
    "When searching values, there are more differences, with the heap, the time complexity is directly related to the number of elements in the heap, O(n) where n is the number of elements. The BST however is slightly more complicated. Because my BST code doesn't ensure balance (the height of left and right subtrees only differ by 1 when inserting values) my tree can end skewed. This changees the time complxity from O(log(n)) for a balanced tree to O(n) which matches the speed of the heap. So for the searchng of values both structures perform exactly the same athough the BST could be optimized later to make it faster for larger values of n. Changing my BST to a balanced tree likely wouldn't garner massive results right away because I only have 36 data points, but if expanded to include more points, the O(log(n)) vs O(n) makes a huge difference.\n",
