    " Data comes from a .csv file sourced from https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/washington-state/men/2024-gamelogs-advanced.html. I loaded it into Microsoft Excel and cleaned it dropping all of the stats collected for each game except the scores, date, school played, and location of the game. There were no missing or null values as the season has now ended and all of the data from each game was present. A few of the column names were not named in a way that would allow for easy access so I had to rename the WorL column as well as the dates. Additiionally, the location of the games is denoted using symbols. Previously it was left blank for a home game, had an @ symbol for an away game and an n for neutral venues. I decided to change the symbols to capital letters and add H for home games instead of having a blank value."

    "Operation Review:\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing finding the maximum and minimum value games we encounter our first limitation. Using the Binary Search Tree, it is a pretty quick operation with a big o notation of O(h) where h is the height of the tree meaning that because we just follow the tree down to the left or right the time we take is dependant on the number of nodes we traverse vertically. Using the Heap, it is much quicker with a big o notation of O(1) because the max or min is always the top most node. However the limitation is that depending on the type of heap you can only find the max or min in O(1) while the other is much slower because you have to search the entire tree for the other value.\n",
    "\n",
    "When searching values, there are more differences, with the heap, the time complexity is directly related to the number of elements in the heap, O(n) where n is the number of elements. The BST however is slightly more complicated. Because my BST code doesn't ensure balance (the height of left and right subtrees only differ by 1 when inserting values) my tree can end skewed. This changes the time complxity from O(log(n)) for a balanced tree to O(n) which matches the speed of the heap. So for the searchng of values both structures perform exactly the same athough the BST could be optimized later to make it faster for larger values of n. Changing my BST to a balanced tree likely wouldn't garner massive results right away because I only have 36 data points, but if expanded to include more points, the O(log(n)) vs O(n) makes a huge difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the sorting of the lists. For creating a sorted list of the BST elements, we simply just traverse the tree in order since the values are placed to the left and right of the nodes based on whether they are greater than or less than the element above. Because of this property we simply traverse the nodes in a specific order, getting the left child(the lesser value) the root(the middle value) and the right(the greater value) this process is repeated for all nodes in the tree and will visit them in ascending order. Once again for the BST this leads to a time complexity controled by the number of nodes in each tree. For the heap we have access to the interesting Heap Sort method. Because the maximum value (or minimum if we had used a min heap) is the root node we can simply \"pop\" that off of the stack and re-heapify our list. This gives a time complexity of O(n log n) where n is the number of nodes. Compared to the BST time complexity this is worse for sets that have more than 10 items.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you may ask, if the BST beats the time complexity of the heap in all of these operations then what is the point of using a heap anyway?\n",
    "\n",
    "Heaps vastly outperform the BST when it comes to adding and removing values. When a value is added to the BST it take O(n) where n is the number of nodes because every time you add a value you have to traverse the tree to find exactly where it belongs. With the Heap because its looser with its placement rules, you can add a value to the bottom of the heaps subtrees and simply check if it violates the heaps rules. If the value is bigger (or smaller if its a min heap) you simply just move it up a row. This means that in a worst case scenario you will end up moving a value from the bottom of the tree to the top creating a time complexity of O(log(n)) as the number of elements in each row doubles as you add rows. This means that when comparing big and unbalanced BST trees to Heaps the heap has a remarkable advantage when removing and adding elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project however that doesn't really matter. It is safe to conclude that because I am working with a small data set that doesn't change or have the requirement of adding or removing values the Binary Search Tree is the best structure when compared to the Heap. If the project were interested in updating the values or adding and removing data as it became relevant or irrelevant or processing important values in an order then the heap would be the right pick."
