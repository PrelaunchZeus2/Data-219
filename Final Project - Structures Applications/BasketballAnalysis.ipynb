    "Below is the code for the binary search tree. Essentially we start with a data point as our \"root\" or starting point. Then when inserting data we insert points \"under\" the node as a \"child\" to the left or right based on whether a specified value is greater than or less than the roots specified value. Because a node can only have two children if a node has 2 children already we just move \"down\" a node and insert there instead. This means that a binary search tree will gain height as we add nodes. \n",

    "Searching for nodes is different however because we have to individually check the value of each node assisted by the fact that we can figure out where to search more efficenetly based on whether the value of the current examined node is greater than or less than our searched for value if that is the information we construct our tree around, otherwise it is random as wee search the tree whether we find it or not."
