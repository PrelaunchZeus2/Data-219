I completed the assignment and I have no errors when I run each block of code, but I noticed that with regards to the .drop_duplicates method and the final line to list the top 5 foreign language films that it didnt seem to properly drop the duplicate line. The top two foreign language films appear to be the same thing even though the .drop_duplicates() function properly ran, there must be some whitespace or a value that isnt duplicated across the entire row that I don't know how to source and find at this time. Potentially something to revisit later when I have more experience.
