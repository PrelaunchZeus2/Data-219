I completed the assignment and I have no errors when I run each block of code, but I noticed that with regards to the .drop_duplicates method and the final line to list the top 5 foreign language films that it didnt seem to properly drop the duplicate line. The top two foreign language films appear to be the same thing even though the .drop_duplicates() function properly ran. Is there a more advanced way to check the whitespace of the row to make sure there all the duplicates are properly dropped?
Thanks, JS
