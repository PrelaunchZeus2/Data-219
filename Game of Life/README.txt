This program was created using the HW1 instructions in the assignment1.pdf file.
I ran into some issues early on in the assignment where my installation of python did not come with some of the libraries that we used in this project, but I was able to find installation instructions for mac using homebrew online and my program seems to run fine now.
There shouldn't be any extra additions needed to run/compile the code as long as you have all of the files.
